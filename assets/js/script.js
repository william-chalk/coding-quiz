//When the start button is clicked then a timer starts and the first question appears
//When a answer is selected then another question appers
//When a question is answered incorrectly then time is subtracted from the clock
//When all questions are answered or the time is equal to 0 then the quiz is over
//When the game is over then I can enter my initials and score
